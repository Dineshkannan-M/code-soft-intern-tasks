        <p class="lead">
          Pet rescue groups were born out of a need to save adoptable dogs and cats and find them homes. Years ago, shelters were the place most strays and unwanted pets ended up. When the shelters got full and a pet was there too long, the pet was killed to make room for other more adoptable animals coming in, or sold for laboratory research. It was, and still is, a very sad situation when a healthy pet is euthanized as a direct result of human neglect or ignorance. The staff working in shelters are forced to make incredibly gut-wrenching decisions every day, mostly caused by pet overpopulation and the failure of too many people to recognize that pets should be spayed or neutered.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Today, there are many No Kill shelters, where adoptable pets are not killed, but the problem of overcrowding persists. There are now breed-specific rescue groups for nearly every canine breed, as well as groups that rescue any dog. There are also groups that rescue cats, rabbits, birds, ferrets, and other pets.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          We urge everyone to, 'Please consider adoption first'. Adoption is not for everyone, but there are many wonderful pets that will love you forever if you bring them home with you.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Helping Homeless Pets will be created in the future to support volunteer-based pet rescue organizations. We help unwanted pets get a second chance at a new home and aim to reduce the number of pets that may become homeless or abandoned. We do this by supporting our member pet rescue groups, facilitating collaborations, and raising awareness among current and future pet owners.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          HHP requires that our member rescues observe a Code of Conduct. A Code of Ethics is also in place for dog and cat rescues.
